# BreezeApp Refactoring Plan: A Contract-First, Test-Driven Approach

**Project:** BreezeApp Refactoring
**Goal:** Successfully decouple the UI (`breeze-app-ui`) from the AI services (`breeze-app-router`) into a robust, maintainable, and scalable dual-app architecture using a clean AIDL-based IPC mechanism. All development must adhere strictly to **MVVM + Clean Architecture (Use Cases)** principles.

---

### **1. Overall Architecture & Guiding Principles**

#### **Module Boundaries**

The high-level architecture is composed of three main modules. The two applications (`breeze-app-ui` and `breeze-app-router`) are completely decoupled and only communicate through the shared `shared-contracts` module.

```mermaid
graph LR;
    subgraph "breeze-app-ui (Client App)"
        UI_COMPONENTS["- AIRouterClient<br/>- ViewModels<br/>- MockRouterService"]
    end

    subgraph "shared-contracts (AIDL & Models)"
        CONTRACTS["- IAIRouter.aidl<br/>- AIRequest.kt (Parcelable)"]
    end
    
    subgraph "breeze-app-router (Service App)"
        ROUTER_COMPONENTS["- AIRouterService<br/>- AI Engines<br/>- Runtime Settings"]
    end

    UI_COMPONENTS -- "depends on" --> CONTRACTS;
    ROUTER_COMPONENTS -- "depends on" --> CONTRACTS;
```

#### **Architectural Layers**

The application is divided into distinct layers, each with a clear responsibility. Communication flows from the UI down to the native layer and back.

**Presentation Layer (`breeze-app-ui`)**: Contains UI elements (Activities/Fragments) and ViewModels. It is responsible for displaying data and handling user interaction. It knows nothing about how data is fetched, only that it gets it from a Use Case.
**Domain Layer (`breeze-app-ui` & `shared-contracts`)**: Contains the business logic (Use Cases) and the core domain models (e.g., `AIRequest`, `AIResponse`). It defines the `Repository` interfaces that the presentation layer uses.
**Data Layer (`breeze-app-ui` & `breeze-app-router`)**: Contains the `Repository` implementations. Its job is to fetch data from one or more sources (the AI Router Service, a local database, etc.) and deliver it to the Domain layer. `AIRouterRepositoryImpl` in the UI app will handle the IPC communication.
**AI Engine Layer (`breeze-app-router`)**: The `AIRouterService` lives here. It orchestrates calls to various AI engines (LLM, VLM, ASR, etc.) based on the incoming requests from the Data Layer.
**Runtime Layer (`breeze-app-router`)**: Manages the execution backend (CPU/GPU/NPU) and model files, providing a generalized interface for the AI Engine layer.
**Native Layer (`breeze-app-router`)**: The core C++/JNI implementation of the AI models.

#### **Communication Flow (AIDL)**

The following diagram illustrates the end-to-end communication for a user request.

```

#### **AI Router Architecture: Extensibility & Strategy**

To ensure the `breeze-app-router` is a flexible and future-proof platform, its internal architecture will be built on the **Strategy Design Pattern**. This allows us to add, remove, or switch out AI backends (runners) without altering the core service logic.

* **Core Components:**
  
  * **AIEngineManager:** The central coordinator within the router app. It receives an `AIRequest`, determines the required function (LLM, VLM, ASR, Guardrail, etc.), and delegates the task to the currently configured `Runner`.
  * **Runner Interface (`interface Runner<REQUEST, RESPONSE>`):** A generic interface that all runners for a specific AI function will implement. This enforces a common contract.
  * **Concrete Runners:** These are the specific implementations of the `Runner` interface. For each AI function, we can have multiple, swappable runners.
    * **LLM Runners:** `ExecuTorchLLMRunner`, `LlamaCppLLMRunner`, `MediaTekLLMRunner`, etc.
    * **ASR Runners:** `SystemASRRunner`, `SherpaOnnxASRRunner`, etc.
  * **Guardrail & Future Functions:** This design makes it trivial to add new capabilities like content safety checks. We would simply define a `GuardrailRunner` and implement it, and the `AIEngineManager` would be updated to call it in the processing pipeline.

* **"Mock-First" Development Principle:**
  
  * For initial development and integration testing (**Milestones 2-4**), we will exclusively use **`MockRunner`** implementations (e.g., `MockLLMRunner`, `MockASRRunner`).
  * These mocks will simulate the behavior of a real runner (e.g., return a pre-defined text stream, simulate a delay) but have no native dependencies.
  * **Benefit:** This decouples the UI team's development from the complex, time-consuming work of implementing the native runners, allowing for parallel workstreams and a much faster path to end-to-end integration testing.

#### **Core Principles for Robustness**

To build a production-quality system, we will adhere to the following core principles throughout development:

1. **Security:** The `AIRouterService` will be protected by a `signature`-level permission. This ensures that only applications signed with our key (i.e., `breeze-app-ui`) can bind to and communicate with the service, preventing unauthorized access.
2. **Threading:** All IPC calls must be handled off the main thread to prevent UI freezes (ANRs).
   * **Client-Side (`breeze-app-ui`):** Repository calls to the service binder will be dispatched to a background thread (`Dispatchers.IO`).
   * **Service-Side (`breeze-app-router`):** Long-running inference tasks within the service will be launched in a dedicated coroutine scope to avoid blocking the binder thread pool.
3. **Error Handling & Resilience:** The connection must be resilient to failures.
   * **Connection:** The client-side repository will implement a reconnection strategy (e.g., exponential backoff) if the service connection is lost unexpectedly.
   * **Calls:** All binder calls will be wrapped in `try-catch` blocks to handle `RemoteException`.
   * **Data:** The `AIResponse` object will be designed to carry either a success payload or a structured error, making failures an explicit part of the contract.
4. **Configuration:** The service will be configured via a dedicated `initialize` method in the AIDL interface, using a `Configuration` Parcelable to pass settings. This is more robust than passing data via the `startService` Intent.

### **2. The New Roadmap: Milestone-Driven Development**

We will follow a "contract-first" and "service-first" approach. Each milestone represents a stable, verifiable state of the project. **We will not proceed to the next milestone until all tasks in the current one are marked as "Done" and validated.** The core principle is to build and validate the `breeze-app-router` service as a standalone component *before* developing the UI client.

* **Objective:** Implement a client-side `AIRouterRepository` in `breeze-app-ui` that can securely and robustly bind to the **pre-validated** `AIRouterService`.
* **Note:** The implementation of the repository, its data models, and error handling should closely follow the detailed designs in **`client_api_spec.md`**.

* **Implementation & Validation Tracking:**
  
  | Task                                                                           | Status    | Validation Method                                 | Unit Test                 |

#### **Milestone 5: Full E2E Integration**

* **Objective:** Validate the complete end-to-end communication loop: send a message from the UI App, have it received by the Router App, and get a mock response back.
* **Note:** The implementation of the ViewModel, its state management, and interaction with the UseCase should follow the patterns in **`client_api_spec.md`**.
