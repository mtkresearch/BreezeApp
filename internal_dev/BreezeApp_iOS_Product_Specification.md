### **File 1: BreezeApp for iOS - Product Specification (v2)**

**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** September 11, 2025
**Audience:** Product Managers, Stakeholders, Partner Developers

#### **1.0 Vision & Mission**

**Vision:** To establish BreezeApp as the central, on-device AI hub for iOS. It will function both as a feature-rich, standalone application and as a powerful, privacy-first engine that any third-party developer can leverage to bring AI capabilities to their own apps.

**Mission:** To democratize on-device AI on iOS by creating a single, user-installable "AI Brain" for the phone. We will provide a seamless experience for end-users and a simple, powerful integration path for developers, removing the barrier to entry for creating sophisticated mobile AI applications.

#### **2.0 Core Product Goals & Philosophy**

*   **A Central AI Engine:** BreezeApp is not just an app; it's a service. Once installed, it stands by, ready to serve AI requests from other applications on the user's device.
*   **Privacy-First, On-Device Processing:** The engine's primary function is to run AI tasks directly on the user's hardware. No data leaves the device unless a user explicitly chooses a cloud-based AI model.
*   **Radical Simplicity for Developers:** Third-party developers should need zero AI expertise. By integrating our simple SDK, they can add chat, voice, and vision features to their apps in minutes.
*   **User in Control:** The main BreezeApp application will act as the "control panel." Users can manage their AI models, view performance, and control which apps have access to the AI engine.
*   **A Hybrid, Extensible "Runner" System:** The engine will be capable of routing AI requests to the best available "runner," whether it's a hyper-efficient on-device model (using Apple's Neural Engine) or a powerful cloud-based API (like OpenRouter), giving users and developers maximum flexibility.

#### **3.0 Key Features & Capabilities**

##### **For End-Users (in the BreezeApp Application):**

1.  **Full-Featured AI Assistant:** A beautiful, standalone app for chat, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and image-based Q&A.
2.  **Engine Control Center:** A settings area to manage all AI capabilities.
    *   Download, update, and switch between different on-device AI models.
    *   Connect to and manage API keys for cloud-based AI services.
    *   Set the default runners for different tasks (e.g., "use Llama 3 for chat," "use a local model for TTS").
3.  **Performance Dashboard:** Visually showcases the AI engine at work, reinforcing the on-device nature of the processing.

##### **For Third-Party Developers:**

1.  **`BreezeKit` SDK:** A lightweight, easy-to-use Swift package that developers add to their apps.
2.  **Zero-Config AI Features:** The SDK provides simple function calls (e.g., `Breeze.chat(...)`) that automatically and securely route requests to the user's installed BreezeApp engine. The developer's app gets the results back without ever touching the AI logic.
3.  **Fallback Functionality:** If a user doesn't have BreezeApp installed, the SDK can provide a default, baseline functionality (e.g., by using a public cloud API) to ensure the developer's app still works.
