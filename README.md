# Overview

This project aims to create a community-driven platform for running AI capabilities locally on Android devices. Our goal is to provide a privacy-focused solution where all AI features work completely offline (airplane mode supported), ensuring your data never leaves your device.

## About

Breeze2 Android Demo is a privacy-focused AI assistant that runs completely offline on your Android device. It features local language models for chat, voice input/output, and image understanding capabilities. All processing happens on your device - no cloud services, no data collection, just pure local AI power in your pocket.

> [!NOTE]
> Unreasonable or abnormal responses from <b>CPU<b> backend are known issues (see <a href="https://github.com/mtkresearch/Breeze2-android-demo/issues/5">issue #5</a>). These issues are being investigated and will be fixed in future updates.

## Download & Try the App üöÄ
You can download the latest APK from [here](https://huggingface.co/MediaTek-Research/Breeze2-android-demo/resolve/main/breeze2-android-demo.apk).

> [!CAUTION]
> After installing the APK, you'll need to download and set up the required model files:
> 1. The app requires LLM model files that need to be downloaded separately and pushed to your device
> 2. Please follow the model setup instructions in the [Download required model files](#setup) section below (Step 4)
> 3. Without the model files, the app will not be able to function properly


## Project Vision
This app serves as an entry point for everyone, especially those not familiar with coding, to experience AI features directly on their phones. As MediaTek Research continues to develop and provide powerful AI models with various capabilities, this app will act as a carrier to showcase these models and make them accessible to users.

## Community Focus
As a kick-off project, we acknowledge that there might be stability issues and areas for improvement. We welcome developers and enthusiasts to join us in enhancing this project. Feel free to:
- Report issues or bugs
- Suggest new features
- Submit pull requests
- Share your experience and feedback

Together, let's build a privacy-focused AI experience that everyone can use!

5. Build the project in Android Studio



## Architecture

The application follows a service-based architecture where each AI capability (LLM, VLM, ASR, TTS) is implemented as an Android service. Each service supports multiple backends with graceful fallback:

1. Primary MediaTek backend (üöß Still in development...)
2. ‚≠êÔ∏è Open-source alternatives (Executorch/Sherpa)
3. Android system defaults

Key components:
- `ChatActivity`: Main UI for text/voice interaction
- `AudioChatActivity`: Dedicated voice interface (üöß Still in development...)
- `*EngineService`: Service implementations for each AI capability

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please read our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting pull requests.

## Known Issues

1. **VLM Support (Executorch)**: VLM features are currently non-functional due to limitations in Executorch's image processing capabilities. See [executorch#6189](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/issues/6189) for updates.

2. **Audio Chat Interface**: The dedicated voice interface (`AudioChatActivity`) is still under development and may have limited functionality.

3. **MediaTek NPU Backend**: Support for MediaTek NPU acceleration is currently in development. Only CPU inference is fully supported at this time.

Please check our [Issues](https://github.com/mtkresearch/Breeze2-android-demo/issues) page for the most up-to-date status of these and other known issues.
